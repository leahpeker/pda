# File Size Limit

Aim to keep files under ~300 lines. 500 lines is the hard max — never exceed it.

## How to Split

- **Python/Django**: Extract model groups, schema groups, or endpoint groups into separate `_module.py` files (e.g., `_surveys.py`, `_events.py`). Helpers go in a `utils.py` or `helpers.py` in the same package.
- **React/TypeScript**: Extract components to sibling files or a `components/` subdirectory. Extract reusable logic to custom hooks or `utils/`.

## What Counts

- ~300 lines is the target; files between 300–500 should be split when practical. Files over 500 must be split immediately.
- Use judgment — a 320-line file with a single clear responsibility is fine; a 250-line file with four unrelated widgets is already too big.
- Count lines in the file as-written.

## When You Notice a Violation

- **Over 500 lines**: Split before or alongside your change — don't leave it for later.
- **Over 300 lines**: If you're adding code, look for a natural seam to split. If no clean split exists, it's okay to defer, but flag it.
