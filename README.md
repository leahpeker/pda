## Environments

| Environment | URL | Branch | Deploys |
|-------------|-----|--------|---------|
| **Production** | [pda.up.railway.app](https://pda.up.railway.app) | `main` | On merge to `main` |
| **Staging** | [staging-pda.up.railway.app](https://staging-pda.up.railway.app) | `staging` | On push to `staging` |

Staging is the preview environment for testing changes before they hit production. All new features and fixes should be verified on staging first.

## Contributing

All changes go through `staging` before `main`.

1. Branch off `staging`: `git checkout staging && git pull && git checkout -b your-feature`
2. Open a pull request targeting `staging` (not `main`)
3. Verify on [staging-pda.up.railway.app](https://staging-pda.up.railway.app) after merge
4. When ready for production, merge `staging` → `main`

Direct pushes to `staging` and `main` are not allowed for contributors.
