## Environments

| Environment | URL | Branch | Deploys |
|-------------|-----|--------|---------|
| **Staging** | [staging-pda.up.railway.app](https://staging-pda.up.railway.app) | `main` | On push to `main` (auto) |
| **Production** | [proteindeficientsanonymous.com](https://proteindeficientsanonymous.com) | `main` | Manual via GitHub Actions |

Staging is the preview environment — merging to `main` auto-deploys staging. Verify there, then manually promote to production via the `deploy railway (production)` workflow in GitHub Actions.

Manual Railway deploys via GitHub Actions (`workflow_dispatch`) are documented in [CLAUDE.md](./CLAUDE.md) (environment section).

## Contributing

1. Branch off `main`: `git checkout main && git pull && git checkout -b your-feature`
2. Open a pull request targeting `main`
3. Verify on [staging-pda.up.railway.app](https://staging-pda.up.railway.app) after merge
4. When ready, run the `deploy railway (production)` GitHub Action to promote to production

Direct pushes to `main` are not allowed for contributors.
